# Claude Code Guidance

Project commands live in `.claude/commands/`. Project skills live in `.claude/skills/`.

# Global Guidance

## Purpose

- Capture the development guidance that applies generally across the repository, regardless of language, framework, or feature area.
- Keep project-specific layout, tooling, migration notes, and product architecture decisions in `agents/guidance/project/guidance.md`.
- Read this file before work, then read the relevant language, framework, and project guidance packages.

## Living Document Philosophy

- Guidance evolves with the codebase. Update it when you discover repeated patterns, architectural decisions, common mistakes, or better ways to explain existing guidance.
- When you encounter durable patterns or learnings that would help future work, update the relevant guidance immediately.
- Before finishing a task, re-check the relevant guidance and decide whether a new lesson, rule refinement, exception, or clarification should be recorded.
- When reflecting at the end of a task, explicitly check for:
  - verification coverage and any failures or timeouts
  - UI and UX consistency with existing patterns
  - reuse of existing components or utilities before creating new ones
  - data handling consistency, including query params, formatting, and error handling
- If no update is needed, state that you reviewed the guidance and decided no changes were warranted.

### How to Update

- Prefer small, incremental edits over large rewrites.
- Add context explaining why a rule exists, not just what it is.
- If a rule becomes obsolete, remove or revise it instead of layering exceptions.
- If two rules conflict, resolve the conflict explicitly.
- Avoid speculative rules. Document decisions made, not hypotheticals.

## Expectations & Best Practices

### Agent Compliance

- Read this file at the start of every task and treat it as required instructions.
- Read the entire document top to bottom and confirm you reviewed all relevant requirements before taking action.
- Before making changes, scan all sections for relevant requirements and follow them explicitly.
- If a request conflicts with this file, call out the conflict and follow the most restrictive rule.
- Read the relevant language, framework, and project guidance before stack-specific or project-specific work.
- Explicitly confirm in the final response that you reviewed and complied with the relevant guidance.

### Match Existing Patterns

- Follow the project's established coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
- Reference similar existing code before implementing new features.

### Tool Use

- If the repository exposes web-search, docs, or context tools, use them only when needed and within repository rules.
- If the repository provides custom CLI tooling, prefer it over ad hoc scripts.

### Verification Required

- Verify changes for each task when there is any reasonable local option.
- Use minimal tools first:
  - Python: `ruff check`, `pytest`, or targeted test files
  - TypeScript and Vue: linter and typecheck
  - C# and .NET: `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`
  - Rust: `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`
  - Focused `grep` or `rg` searches to verify usage patterns
- Treat verification as the default, not optional, and report what you ran.
- Always run the relevant linter on modified files before completing a task. Pre-commit hooks and CI enforce lint rules and will reject unclean code.
- If you cannot run verification, explicitly say why and list the exact commands the user should run.

### Review Reporting

- Full reviews must report every finding in scope, not only the biggest or most representative ones.
- If the same issue appears multiple times, enumerate every audited occurrence or provide the full occurrence list.
- Summaries are fine only when they are paired with a complete findings section.
- List any skipped files, blind spots, or lightly checked areas explicitly.

## General Principles

### Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity, readability, and organization above all else.** Every decision should optimize for code that is easy to understand, intelligently organized, loosely coupled, and minimal in scope.
- **YAGNI first.** Do not add helpers, constants, abstractions, extension points, or configuration layers until the current requirements actually need them.
- **Readability over performance.** If a simpler approach is slightly slower but far easier to understand, choose simplicity. Optimize only when there is a measured, real problem.
- **No defensive programming.** Trust data and contracts. Do not add try or catch blocks, fallback values, or silent error handling just in case.
- **No bloat.** Every line, abstraction, and helper must earn its place. Remove anything that does not improve clarity or correctness.
- **Avoid redundancy.** Remove unnecessary normalization, casting, or fallback logic once you verify the real behavior.
- **KISS and DRY apply by default.** Keep behavior, data shapes, and control flow as simple as the real requirement allows. Reuse an existing source of truth before introducing a second concept, field, helper, or abstraction that models the same thing.
- **Prefer direct usage over one-off helpers.** If a helper is only used once and adds no clarity, inline it.
- **Loose coupling.** Components, modules, and services should have clear boundaries and minimal dependency on each other's internals.
- **Intelligent organization.** Group related things together, separate unrelated things, and make the codebase structure reflect the domain.

### Follow Existing Architecture

- Reference other views, models, serializers, admin files, apps, and folders to mirror the established architecture.
- When adding utilities or one-off data tasks, implement them as management commands, dedicated CLI tools, or equivalent first-class entrypoints instead of placing scripts in the repo root.
- Prefer the clearest end state over the smallest diff. If new work reveals the current structure is the wrong fit, do a focused refactor and remove obsolete code.
- Do not keep layering new logic on top of a messy local design just to avoid rewriting it. If the touched area will be clearer, simpler, and more aligned with guidance after a focused rewrite, rewrite it instead of patching around the existing shape.
- Prefer a clean rewrite of the local unit in scope, such as a file, workflow, view, serializer, or component, over incremental clutter that preserves confusing structure. Keep the rewrite focused, but choose the version future readers will understand fastest.

### Reuse Existing Components

- Reuse existing classes, methods, and structures to preserve consistency and avoid duplication.

### Control Flow

- Keep conditional logic shallow.
- Return early when possible to avoid deep nesting and keep intent clear.

### Keep Logic Simple

- Favor straightforward, explicit code even if it means repeating a line or two.
- Group related steps together so future readers can follow the intent quickly.
- Do not over-engineer solutions. Avoid unnecessary abstractions, helper functions, or complex patterns when a simple approach works.
- If the current local design has become harder to understand than the underlying requirement, prefer a focused rewrite of that local unit over preserving the complexity with one more layer.
- Do not keep speculative structures around for imagined future reuse. When future requirements become real, refactor then.
- Be deterministic.
  - If something must be uniquely identified, require the full identity at the API boundary.
  - Do not guess by matching on non-unique fields.
  - Avoid best-effort fallback logic that masks underlying issues.
  - When required data is expected, access it directly and fail fast.
  - When a non-fatal exception must be caught, such as a cache miss or optional external call, log it at `warning` with `exc_info=True` so the failure stays visible.
- Fix root problems, not symptoms.
  - Identify and fix the underlying cause instead of adding a band-aid.
  - Do not add defensive code to handle edge cases that should not exist.
  - If data is malformed, fix the source rather than adding cleanup code everywhere.
  - Fallback logic should only exist for legitimate alternative paths.
- Keep code readable.
  - Use logical spacing to separate chunks of code.
  - Avoid comments or docstrings unless they explain non-obvious logic, the reason something is done, or a business rule that is not self-evident.
  - Prefer full descriptive variable names and avoid abbreviations unless they are universally clear.
  - Eliminate redundant null checks and unnecessary intermediate variables.
- Combine conditions when they lead to the same outcome.
- Encapsulate fragile third-party integrations behind a small service layer so views, commands, and tasks use a stable interface.

### Parameters and Variables

- Do not add unused parameters to function signatures.
- Remove unused parameters instead of suppressing warnings.

### ID Generation (If Applicable)

- If you use incremental counters for IDs, make the semantics explicit and use them consistently across the codebase.

### God Module Prevention

- One responsibility per file.
- Watch for growth signals. When a file exceeds roughly 300 lines or handles three or more unrelated concerns, split it.
- Name files by their responsibility, not by their location. Avoid names such as `common.py`, `utils.py`, and `helpers.py` when more specific names would clarify intent.
- Apply this across all stacks.

### Dead Code Discipline

- Delete commented-out code.
- Remove dead dependencies.
- Remove dead features unless there is a documented reason they must remain.

### Security Rules

- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Never ship unauthenticated API endpoints.
- Scope data to the current user or tenant.
- Tests must verify ownership boundaries.
- Avoid wildcard `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in production.

### Logging Discipline

- Log at boundaries, not every intermediate step.
- Use one structured line per event.
- Aim for roughly five log lines per method maximum.
- Remove development-only logging before merge.
- Use proper logging frameworks instead of `print()` or `Console.WriteLine` in production code.
- Do not use joke or placeholder log messages.

### Dependency Hygiene

- Declare all dependencies.
- Pin versions.
- Remove unused dependencies.
- Keep dependency versions consistent across projects that share packages.

### Tooling & CLI Contracts

- Honor all declared CLI arguments.
- Do not hardcode user paths.
- Use context managers or equivalent scoped resource cleanup for files, database connections, and disposable resources.

## Code Review Practices

- Verify usage before claiming redundancy.
- Gather comprehensive context first.
- Distinguish intentional design from accidental complexity.
- Document architectural decisions when you discover why something is designed a certain way.
- Create refactoring plans before implementing non-trivial structural changes.

### Readability And Structure Review

- Full reviews should assess file structure, folder structure, module boundaries, and code shape together, not as separate afterthoughts.
- If you cannot summarize the purpose of a file, module, or workflow in one sentence, treat that as a signal that the structure may be too complex.
- Prefer the smallest change that restores clarity, explicit control flow, and sensible boundaries.
- Review public API surface, helper count, and abstraction layers for proportionality to the real problem being solved.

### Centralize Constants

- Move feature-level constants and configuration into the appropriate settings system instead of duplicating module-level config.
- Keep large SQL or query text in code, not in settings.

## Consistency Checklist

### Cross-Stack

- [ ] No secrets or credentials in source code
- [ ] No god modules introduced or expanded
- [ ] No commented-out dead code left behind
- [ ] No unauthenticated endpoints added
- [ ] Data scoped to the current user or tenant where applicable
- [ ] All dependencies declared and version-pinned
- [ ] Logging uses the proper framework, not print or console output
- [ ] Verification commands ran and results were reported
- [ ] This file was reviewed for needed updates

## Intent

- Reduce cognitive load.
- Preserve architectural integrity.
- Keep the codebase approachable for new contributors.
- Prevent over-engineering and accidental complexity.
- Enable confident, fast iteration.

These guidelines are constraints in service of clarity, not bureaucracy. If following a rule would make the code worse, pause and update the rule.

## Languages

# Python Guidance

## Purpose

- Capture Python-specific conventions that apply across backend and agent code.
- Keep Django, DRF, and Celery rules in `agents/guidance/frameworks/django/guidance.md`.
- Keep repository- or product-specific architecture decisions in `agents/guidance/project/guidance.md`.

## Key Patterns

### Organization And Imports

- Order imports as standard library, third-party, framework, then project-local.
- Place imports at the top of the file.
- Avoid inline imports inside functions unless you are breaking a circular dependency and there is no cleaner option.
- Avoid wildcard imports.
- Prefer direct, explicit project import paths over re-exported or indirect paths when the direct module is clearer.
- Keep `__init__.py` files minimal. Use them only for module declarations or explicit exports when that materially improves imports.
- Do not put runtime logic, workflow code, view classes, or business logic in `__init__.py` files unless there is a strong, unavoidable reason.

### Implementation

- Stick to single quotes unless triple quotes are required.
- Use logical spacing between imports, constants, classes, and function groups.
- Use one blank line between methods and two blank lines between classes.
- Keep functions small; extract helpers only when they are reused or materially improve clarity.
- Prefer explicit, descriptive names over abbreviations.
- Catch specific exceptions and let unexpected errors surface.
- Avoid dynamic `getattr` and `setattr` unless they are truly necessary.

### Classes And Stateful OOP

- Prefer a class when multiple methods share the same subject, dependency, or workflow state.
- Store stable dependencies and shared context in `__init__` instead of threading them through every method call.
- Keep instance state small and intentional: one domain object, one client, one config object, or a few workflow flags is usually enough.
- Prefer one clear public entrypoint with focused private helpers when a workflow has multiple steps.
- Use private helper methods to break up a larger workflow only when they genuinely share the same instance state.
- Use `@staticmethod` only for logic that does not depend on instance state.
- Use abstract base classes only when multiple implementations truly share the same contract.
- If a class owns resources such as temp files, sessions, or connections, make setup and cleanup explicit, ideally with a context manager.
- Do not create a class when a single pure function would be clearer.

### Types And Readability

- Do not use `from __future__ import annotations` for type hints.
- Use `typing.Optional` and `typing.Union` instead of the `|` union syntax.
- Use builtin collection types such as `list`, `dict`, and `tuple` instead of `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, and `typing.Tuple`.
- Avoid regex when an exact match works.
- Avoid type-only casts and broad `# type: ignore[...]` pragmas when a clearer boundary exists.
- At third-party integration boundaries, prefer real stubs or isolated service-layer workarounds over broad `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` usage.

### Verification

- Run `ruff check` on modified Python files before completing a task.
- Prefer targeted `pytest` runs first when shared infrastructure is unchanged.
- When changing formatter or lint settings in new Python projects, prefer a 120-character-friendly line length unless repository constraints require something else.
- Keep local formatting and import ordering aligned with the repository's active lint and formatter configuration.

### HTTP, Adapters, And Debugging

- Use concrete HTTP verb helpers such as `requests.get` and `requests.post` when the method is already known.
- Do not hide straightforward request flow or one-off logic behind tiny wrapper helpers that only shuffle arguments around.
- Prefer built-in logging or framework error paths over ad hoc print debugging in committed code.

### Testing

- Keep Python tests explicit and readable.
- Prefer explicit fixture builders and helper methods over catch-all `**kwargs` patterns.

## Consistency Checklist

### Python

- Imports are explicit, ordered, and top-level.
- `__init__.py` files stay minimal.
- Typing follows repository conventions.
- `ruff check` expectations are clear and were followed for modified files.
- Django-specific behavior is documented in the Django guide instead of being duplicated here.

## Frameworks

# Django Guidance

## Purpose

- Capture Django, DRF, and Celery conventions.
- Keep Python-wide conventions in `agents/guidance/languages/python/guidance.md`.
- Keep product- and repository-specific domain architecture in `agents/guidance/project/guidance.md`.

## App Structure

- For small or medium Django apps, a conventional app-root layout with `models.py`, `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`, `admin.py`, and `tests/` is fine when the surface area is still easy to scan.
- In larger Django apps, prefer a feature-foldered layout with app-root files plus `views/`, `services/`, `tests/`, `management/`, and `models/` packages when the surface area warrants it.
- When a repository separates transport from domain code, keep domain models and admin in domain apps and group DRF routes under a dedicated `api/` app or namespace instead of mixing every endpoint into the model app.
- Keep feature API code in `views/<feature>/` packages or `api/<domain>/<feature>/` packages with `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`, and `tests/` colocated when that organization improves ownership and discoverability.
- Use the app-layout example as the baseline when deciding between `models.py` and a `models/` package, or between flat files and feature packages.
- Keep the project-root `urls.py` thin and use it to include the main app or API hubs.
- Keep the app-root `urls.py` thin and use it as an include hub for feature URL modules.
- Keep app-wide model tests in `<app>/tests/` and feature-specific API tests next to the feature package when that split keeps responsibilities clearer.
- When an app has many models, prefer a `models/` package with one model per file and re-export from `models/__init__.py` instead of growing one giant `models.py`.
- When using a `models/` package, name each model file after the model class itself, such as `InvoiceBatch.py`, instead of snake_case filenames such as `invoice_batch.py`. This keeps model-package imports and file discovery aligned with the class names they define.
- Keep service modules in `<app>/services/` and management commands under `<app>/management/commands/`.

## Data Ownership And Organization Scoping

- Every authenticated endpoint must scope data to the current user or organization. This is a security requirement, not a convenience.
- List endpoints must filter by ownership, such as `request.user`, `request.employee.company`, or the equivalent boundary.
- Detail, update, and delete endpoints must verify that the requested object belongs to the current user or organization before operating on it.
- Tests must verify ownership boundaries. If an endpoint is scoped to user A, add a test proving user B cannot see user A's data.
- When multi-organization middleware exists, keep queries flowing through that boundary instead of re-implementing organization selection ad hoc.
- When repeated scoping depends on a request-owned domain object such as `request.employee` or `request.member`, attach it once in middleware and let views and serializers reuse that shared boundary.

## Views And APIs

### View Basics

- Keep views thin: permission checks first, object lookup or queryset shaping next, serializer validation after that, then response serialization.
- Keep view attribute ordering consistent and follow the canonical view examples for shared helpers, object lookup, and response flow.
- All views should inherit from the repository's shared base API view when one exists.
- Reuse existing lookup patterns with `get_object_or_404`.
- Reuse shared permission and request-validation helpers when the repository already provides them.
- For custom permissions, use the repository's shared permission helpers instead of indexing `_meta.permissions` or hand-building strings.

### Query Parameters And Filtering

- Trust internal API data and avoid excessive defensive parsing.
- Use direct conversion for common params, such as `int(request.query_params.get('page', 1))`.
- Skip local try-except wrappers for routine query-param parsing unless you need a standardized DRF validation error.
- When you need a standardized `400`, use a DRF field converter and let `ValidationError` bubble up.
- For comma-separated lists, parse them with straightforward splitting and trimming.
- Prefer passing defaults into `request.query_params.get(...)` directly.
- Backend query params must be snake_case. Do not add new camelCase query params.
- Avoid reserved renderer names such as `format` for feature-specific query params.
- Reuse shared helpers for common query param shapes, such as date ranges or CSV lists, instead of re-implementing them.
- Favor queryset scoping over branching. Build a base queryset, then apply optional filters.
- Finish list querysets with deterministic ordering, typically `.order_by('id')`, and add `.distinct()` when joins can duplicate rows.
- Keep metadata builders straightforward with early returns, single-purpose helpers, and shallow loops.

### API Structure

- Add views, serializers, and URLs inside the app you are updating.
- Mirror existing `urls.py` and `views.py` layouts for routing and logic decisions.
- Create view and serializer tests in the app's `tests` package when behavior changes.
- Design API responses so the frontend can match rows deterministically.
- Prefer composite identifiers when a display name is not globally unique.
- Avoid backend logic that matches rows by a non-unique attribute.
- Backend API responses must use snake_case so the frontend API client can convert them consistently.
- Mutating endpoints must return the created or updated resource. Do not return empty `{}` payloads on success.
- Serialize POST and PUT response bodies through output serializers instead of ad hoc dict construction.
- When responding with selectable options from Django `choices`, use a shared helper when the repository already provides one.
- For integration-heavy endpoints, keep views thin, call small service modules, and let operator retry screens read sync-event records instead of inferring integration history from order or enrollment state.

### Permission And Request Patterns

- Verify context first at the top of every action.
- Pair membership checks with staff checks for staff-only actions.
- When a view behaves differently for owners and staff, copy the existing permission pattern rather than inventing a new one.
- Use property-scoped checks for property-owned resources.
- Use explicit permission checks for cross-entity reads.
- Raise `PermissionDenied` when owned-resource business rules fail.
- For serializers that need enforced context, wrap request data in an `edited_data` dict so callers cannot spoof protected fields.
- Validate special-action query params and return `400 BAD REQUEST` when required values are missing.

## Serializers

### Input And Output Split

- Prefer two serializers per model: `ModelInputSerializer` for writes and `ModelOutputSerializer` for reads.
- Use a single serializer only when input and output requirements are truly identical.
- When one serializer handles both directions, name it `ModelSerializer`.
- Input serializers validate incoming data for POST and PUT requests.
- Output serializers shape response payloads for GET and mutation responses.

### Structure And Fields

- Every serializer needs a `Meta` class with `model` and `fields`.
- Serializer `Meta` inheritance is acceptable when a derived serializer is intentionally extending a base serializer's `fields` tuple or other serializer metadata. Do not apply the concrete-model-`Meta` example to serializers.
- Output serializers should normally set `read_only_fields = fields`.
- Always include `id` first in the fields tuple.
- Verify field tuples for completeness. Duplicate entries can silently hide missing fields.
- For long field lists, keep tuple formatting multi-line and easy to scan.
- Default fields to read-only unless they truly need to be writable.

### Relationships And Computed Data

- Use `source` when exposing related-object fields.
- Use nested output serializers for related collections when that matches surrounding patterns.
- Use `SerializerMethodField` for computed fields.

### Validation And Persistence

- Implement `validate_<field>()` or `validate()` for custom validation.
- When an action depends on identifiers to associate records correctly, validate those identifiers explicitly.
- Implement `create()` or `update()` only when you need explicit control over persistence.
- Always return the saved instance from custom `create()` and `update()` methods.
- Use `.get()` with defaults for optional fields during custom persistence.

## Migrations

- Prefer model-driven schema changes over custom SQL or data migrations whenever Django can represent the change directly.
- When a migration both creates custom permissions and grants them to groups, create or fetch the permission rows inside the migration before assigning groups.
- For model-backed task frameworks where a field such as `name` is intentionally tied to the live task registry, it is acceptable to import the task model and use its `TextChoices` directly in the migration instead of creating a new migration every time a new task name is added. Use this pattern only when the migration is deliberately acting as a registry contract, not for ordinary domain enums that should remain historical schema snapshots.

## Models

- Extend the repository's shared base model when one exists.
- Prefer `models.TextField` for new string fields unless a real length constraint is required.
- Keep model declarations in this order:
  - class definition
  - `Meta`
  - supporting inner classes such as `TextChoices`
  - field declarations
  - optional dunder methods
  - optional `save()` and `delete()`
  - remaining helpers
- For field declarations, prefer this argument order:
  - target model for relations
  - field-specific arguments
  - `default`
  - `null`
  - `blank`
  - `verbose_name`
  - `on_delete` for relations
- Only set `default` when the field has a real domain-level default value.
- Do not use empty-string or other placeholder defaults as a shortcut for optional data, form convenience, or avoiding validation.
- For relation fields, pass the target model as `'app.Model'` and set `on_delete` explicitly.
- Keep field declarations on one line.
- Wrap human-readable `TextChoices` labels in `gettext(...)`.
- Prefer `@staticmethod` for model helpers that do not need class state. Use `@classmethod` only when the helper genuinely depends on `cls`, such as shared permission-name helpers.
- Keep intrinsic lifecycle and invariant rules on the model.
- Prefer direct attribute access over `getattr` when a field is guaranteed by the model or serializer contract.
- Choose an explicit `on_delete` strategy for every relation and follow the repository's established convention unless you are deliberately migrating away from it.
- Be aware of the trade-offs between `DO_NOTHING`, `CASCADE`, `SET_NULL`, and `PROTECT`, and match the actual domain relationship.

### Model Lifecycle Side Effects

- Do not hide third-party I/O in model `save()` or `delete()` methods.
- Keep lifecycle methods limited to database concerns such as defaults, validation, and audit logging.
- Put network I/O in explicit service functions or Celery tasks that views or commands call directly.
- If existing code already has I/O in `save()` or `delete()`, do not add more. When you touch that code, consider extracting the I/O into a service layer.

## Module Boundaries

- Do not add new unrelated concerns to an existing catch-all module.
- If you are touching one concern inside a god module, consider extracting that concern into a dedicated module instead of growing the shared file further.
- In new projects, start with split modules instead of growing a single `common.py`-style catch-all file.
- Keep shared access or base-view modules focused on request context, permission checks, and scoped object resolution. Do not place feature-specific queryset builders or domain query shaping there; keep that logic in the owning app's views, models, or app-local query helpers.

## URL Patterns

- Each app needs its own `urls.py` with `app_name` defined.
- Project-root URL modules should usually own only index, admin, docs, and top-level include boundaries.
- Larger APIs can use layered routing such as project root -> `api/urls.py` -> domain `urls.py` -> feature `urls.py`.
- Import `path` from `django.urls` and import the app's views directly.
- Follow REST-style route naming:
  - list routes end with `-list`
  - create routes end with `-create`
  - detail routes end with `-detail`
- Nested resources should include the parent identifier in the path.
- Feature-local URL modules can live beside feature views inside `views/<feature>/` or `api/<domain>/<feature>/` packages.
- Use kebab-case route names.

## Admin Configuration

- Keep each model's admin registration in that model app's `admin.py` instead of centralizing unrelated registrations in a shared module.
- Register models with `@admin.register(Model)` and subclass `admin.ModelAdmin`.
- Always include `id`, `created_ts`, and `updated_ts` in `list_display` and `readonly_fields`.
- Use `search_fields`, `list_filter`, and `raw_id_fields` where relevant.
- Keep custom actions in the `actions` tuple and label them with `@admin.action(description='...')`.
- Use multi-line tuples when admin field lists grow long.

## Management Commands

- Structure commands around argument parsing, focused helper methods, and early guard clauses so `handle()` stays readable.
- Use `call_command` for programmatic management command execution.

## Background Tasks (Celery)

- Use Celery for background work that does not need to complete synchronously.
- Never run cleanup, purge, or third-party I/O operations in model lifecycle methods or directly in views.
- Follow the repository's task registration pattern consistently so task discovery, scheduling, and retries stay predictable.
- If the task framework supports progress reporting, update task status through the shared progress hooks instead of inventing parallel state tracking.
- When scheduling recurring tasks, use explicit cron syntax such as `crontab(minute='*/30')`.

## Settings Hierarchy

- Follow the repository's established settings inheritance chain instead of inventing ad hoc environment modules.
- Keep shared configuration in the base settings layer and local or environment-specific overrides in dedicated child settings modules.
- Production settings must not hardcode secrets.
- Wildcard imports from base settings are acceptable only inside settings modules.

## Sessions, CSRF, And Frontend Serving

- Use the session-CSRF-SPA example as the baseline when Django APIs are consumed by a browser SPA.
- Prefer Django's cookie-backed session authentication for browser API requests instead of adding JWT, bearer-token, or local-storage auth alongside Django sessions.
- Keep `SessionMiddleware`, `CsrfViewMiddleware`, and `AuthenticationMiddleware` in the request stack, and keep authenticated DRF browser views on `SessionAuthentication`.
- Do not disable CSRF or make browser mutation endpoints CSRF-exempt to work around split-origin local development. Fix `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, credentialed requests, and the bootstrap CSRF flow instead.
- When local development uses separate frontend and backend servers, keep the frontend origin in both CORS and CSRF trusted-origin settings, allow credentials, and make the frontend API client send credentials and the CSRF header.
- Provide one anonymous-safe bootstrap endpoint that sets a CSRF cookie and returns current session state, current user data, organization or access context, and any shell bootstrap data needed before route pages load.
- In production, prefer same-origin API calls from the built frontend served by Django. Keep production hosts and trusted origins environment-driven, require secure cookies, and avoid wildcard `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- Keep frontend session state in the shared shell bootstrap flow instead of asking every route to check authentication or fetch current-user data independently.

## Browser Session SSO

- Use the session SSO example as the baseline when a browser SPA signs in through an OAuth or OIDC identity provider and Django owns the session cookie.
- Keep provider client secrets, token exchange, ID-token validation, profile loading, and profile mapping on the backend. The frontend should only navigate the browser to a backend SSO login URL.
- Store the SSO `state`, provider identifier, and normalized relative frontend redirect path in the server-side session before redirecting to the provider.
- On callback, validate and remove the stored state before exchanging the authorization code. Never create or log in a user after an invalid, missing, or mismatched state.
- Normalize post-login redirects to relative frontend paths. Reject absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and values containing carriage returns or newlines.
- Put provider URLs, scopes, client IDs, client secrets, JWKS URLs, issuer expectations, and request timeouts in settings, with secrets coming from environment variables.
- Expose available auth methods from the anonymous-safe bootstrap endpoint so the frontend can show password and SSO options from backend-owned feature flags or configuration.
- Treat signed ID-token validation as the identity boundary. Verify signature through provider JWKS, expected audience, expiry, issued-at presence, issuer expectations, and provider-specific email ownership claims before linking or creating a user.
- Map provider claims through a small backend service boundary, keep provider-specific trust semantics in mappers or equivalent functions, require a valid email address, and fail on ambiguous account matches.
- Create SSO-only users with an unusable password unless the product explicitly supports password setup after SSO.
- Apply product-specific access checks before calling `login(...)` when an SSO identity can belong to more than one app surface, such as operator and patient portals.
- Log callback failures at `warning` with provider context and `exc_info=True`, then redirect the browser to a stable frontend error code instead of returning provider details.

## Security Checklist

- Do not hardcode secrets in settings files.
- Do not disable CSRF without explicit justification.
- Gate admin tools behind `DEBUG=True` or explicit admin-only access.
- Ensure `.env.secret` files are gitignored.
- Use encrypted fields for sensitive credentials when the project already supports them.

## Services And Shared Helpers

- Wrap external systems behind focused service modules instead of spreading auth, retry, or network details through views and tasks.
- Centralize session-refresh or retry logic inside one service helper instead of repeating reconnect logic at each call site.
- Prefer small service classes when multiple operations share the same client or identity context, but do not cache plain Django settings in `__init__` just to avoid repeated `settings.<VAR>` reads.
- Extract repeated setup or teardown only after multiple call sites clearly share the same boilerplate.
- When a backend workflow naturally breaks into stages, prefer responsibility-based module names such as `adapters/`, `extractors/`, `loaders/`, or `transforms/` instead of generic `utils.py` buckets.
- Avoid near-duplicate views; if two routes need the same behavior, point them at the same view class.
- Prefer normal `.objects` manager access over `_base_manager` unless lower-level behavior is truly required.
- Avoid regex queries when exact equality or `__in` filters express the rule more clearly.
- Read configuration directly from `settings.<VAR>` unless local caching materially improves readability.

## Backend Coding Style And Error Handling

- Review similar apps before adding new patterns.
- Use explicit names such as `instance` and `queryset` to match surrounding code.
- Reuse existing permission checks and common attribute ordering.
- When class-based views expose shared attributes, prefer the common ordering `constants`, `queryset`, `serializer_class`, `permission_classes`, then methods.
- Compare new serializers and views against similar existing ones to maintain structural parity.
- Prefer using `settings.<VAR>` directly instead of copying settings values into local module constants.
- If the repository uses standardized DRF error responses, raise DRF exceptions from views and keep serializer-level validation inside serializers so the shared error shape stays consistent.
- Only return custom `{'detail': ...}` payloads when there is a strong reason and it matches surrounding code.

## Testing Guidelines

- Add reusable object builders to the repository's shared test-fixture helpers, usually `tests/fixtures.py` or an equivalent shared module, instead of creating ad hoc builders inside test modules.
- Keep fixture helpers explicit with named parameters and sensible defaults.
- Place tests alongside their feature modules when that is the local pattern.
- Tests should assign permissions explicitly instead of relying on implicit defaults.

### Serializer Tests

- Create a pytest class per serializer and use `setup_method` for shared setup.
- Cover the happy path, missing required fields, and domain-specific validation.
- When serializers override `create()` or `update()`, add tests that exercise those code paths and confirm persisted state.
- For output serializers, assert the exact field set, verify expected values, inspect nested objects, and confirm there are no unexpected keys.
- When output serializers depend on lookups or helpers, monkeypatch them to deterministic stub values.

### View Tests

- Mirror existing authentication and shared fixture setup from the repository's fixture helpers.
- Resolve permissions with the model's shared permission helpers and grant them explicitly.
- Build endpoint URLs with `django.urls.reverse` instead of hard-coded paths.
- Compare response payloads against serializer output so tests stay aligned with the actual serialization layer.
- Cover positive, permission-negative, and ownership-boundary cases.
- Assert database state after each action.

### Model Tests

- Group related assertions in a single test class per model.
- Prefer shared helper methods for repeated object construction.
- Cover steady-state behavior and state transitions.
- Refresh instances before asserting post-conditions.
- Call `timezone.now()` once per helper to avoid drift-related failures.

## Consistency Checklist

### Django

- Views inherit from the expected base classes.
- Serializer field tuples are complete and non-duplicated.
- URL names follow kebab-case `{model}-{action}` patterns.
- List endpoints are scoped to the current user or organization.
- Mutating endpoints return the created or updated resource.
- Model lifecycle methods do not hide third-party I/O.
- Tests cover permission-positive, permission-negative, and cross-user isolation paths.
- Django-specific examples live in the Django `examples/` folder instead of inline guidance blocks.
- Session-authenticated browser APIs keep CSRF enabled and have a tested bootstrap flow that provides session state and a CSRF token.

# Vue Guidance

## Purpose

- Capture Vue, TypeScript, Pinia, and frontend API conventions.
- Keep item- and repository-specific shell, workspace, branding, and organization architecture in `agents/guidance/project/guidance.md`.

## Frontend Project Structure

- `src/assets` stores static assets such as images and fonts.
- `src/components` stores reusable UI components and app-shell primitives.
- Use `src/components/ui/` for low-level shared controls and surfaces.
- Use `src/components/forms/` for labeled field wrappers that compose `FormField` plus shared input primitives.
- Use `src/components/layout/` for shell containers, scroll frames, and app-level structural wrappers.
- Use `src/components/navigation/` for sidebar, tabs, menus, and other shared navigation pieces.
- Use `src/components/page/` for reusable page-composition blocks such as `PageHeader`, `PageSection`, split layouts, metric cards, and list rows.
- `src/views` stores route-based folders and route entry views.
- Each route folder under `src/views/` can own the route component, local subcomponents, a descriptively named local store file, route-specific composables, types, and constants.
- Keep shared shell-level state under a dedicated shell folder such as `src/views/application/` instead of a top-level catch-all `src/stores/` directory.
- Prefer one primary route-based feature home such as `src/views/` instead of introducing parallel feature-root trees without a migration plan.
- If legacy or transitional code still exists under `src/features/`, migrate it toward `src/views/` as you touch that route area instead of expanding the old structure.
- Keep the canonical API client in one well-known utility or API module instead of adding parallel service directories for the same transport role.
- `src/composables` stores shared Vue composables used across multiple routes.
- `src/router` stores Vue Router configuration.
- `src/types` stores shared global types.
- `src/core` stores core models and utilities.
- `src/styles` stores global styles and CSS utilities.
- Prefer configured import aliases such as `@/views/...`, `@/types/...`, and `@/utils/...` instead of long relative traversal imports when the project supports aliases.

## Shell And Routing

- Keep one shared shell near `App.vue` that mounts the router outlet plus global feedback UI.
- Switch between authenticated and guest layouts in one shared shell or container instead of duplicating layout logic inside route views.
- Keep shell-only pieces grouped under `src/components/application/`, `src/layouts/`, or an equivalent dedicated folder.
- Let the shell own navigation chrome, top-level bootstrap loading states, and router outlet placement.
- Keep page views focused on page composition and domain workflow concerns rather than re-implementing shell structure.
- Prefer route meta flags such as `requiresAuth` with a single global router guard backed by shared auth state.
- For session-backed apps, use the auth-aware shell example as the baseline for bootstrap state, login, logout, guest-only routes, public routes, and permission redirects.
- Keep session bootstrap in the shared shell store, usually under `src/views/application/`, and let the router guard initialize that store once before protected routes render.
- Route views, dialogs, and route-local stores must not call the auth bootstrap endpoint directly. They should read the shared shell store instead.
- Express route access with route metadata such as `requiresAuth`, `guestOnly`, `skipShellBootstrap`, and `requiredPermissions` instead of route-local redirect logic.
- Reset and re-bootstrap the shell store after any frontend flow that creates a new authenticated session, and reset shell state immediately after logout.
- For session-backed SSO, route provider sign-in buttons to backend SSO login URLs and let the backend complete the provider callback, create the Django session, and redirect back to the SPA.
- Preserve the intended destination as a relative redirect path in the SSO login URL, and let the backend reject unsafe redirect values.
- Let the shared shell bootstrap own post-callback session detection. Do not add frontend token parsing, local-storage auth, or route-local provider callback handlers unless the backend contract explicitly requires them.
- Render available password and SSO methods from the bootstrap payload instead of hardcoding provider buttons in the login page.
- Mount notification or snackbar containers once near the app root and drive them from a shared store or composable.
- Use shared global notifications for cross-feature success and error feedback instead of rendering one-off banners inside every page.

## Theme And Tokens

- Prefer one theme source of truth instead of mixing multiple theming systems.
- When Tailwind is the primary styling layer, prefer semantic utility names such as `bg-surface`, `text-body`, and `border-line` over raw palette classes in application components.
- CSS variables are a good theme source of truth when runtime theme switching is needed.
- Apply the active theme at the app root instead of toggling per-page theme classes.
- Reserve accent colors for actions, focus states, and active UI states; keep primary reading text on neutral text tokens.
- Keep radius, border, and shadow choices consistent across shared shells, cards, nav items, and controls.

## Frontend API

### Single API Client Rule

- Maintain exactly one canonical API client.
- Do not keep parallel implementations such as `apiService.ts` and `useApiClient.ts` when they serve the same role.
- The canonical client should centralize Axios configuration, CSRF handling, snake_case to camelCase conversion, and typed response handling.
- Outside of tests, `axios` imports should live only in the canonical API client layer.
- Put the canonical client in one obvious location, commonly `src/utils/api.ts` or `src/api/client.ts`, and make that location the only runtime Axios owner.
- For Django session-backed browser apps, keep `withCredentials`, XSRF cookie/header configuration, and any Django-rendered CSRF token handoff inside the canonical API client setup path.
- Do not introduce a separate auth API client or local-storage token helper for login, logout, registration, password reset, or invitation acceptance flows.

### API Client Patterns

- Route every request through the canonical shared frontend API client.
- Use `apiClient.get(...)`, `apiClient.post(...)`, `apiClient.put(...)`, and `apiClient.delete(...)` for JSON API requests.
- Use `apiClient.postForm(...)` and `apiClient.putForm(...)` for `FormData` uploads.
- Use `apiClient.setCsrfToken(...)` only at shell/bootstrap boundaries when a CSRF token is read from the rendered page.
- Keep SSO login URL builders near the canonical API client so they share the same API base URL, but use normal browser navigation for SSO redirects instead of `apiClient.get(...)`.
- Backend responses should stay snake_case; the client layer converts them to camelCase.
- Components, composables, stores, and route views should work only with camelCase field names.
- The API client converts POST and PUT JSON request bodies from camelCase to snake_case before sending them to the backend.
- Query params should be passed to `buildParamsConfig(...)` as camelCase objects so the shared helper can convert them to snake_case.
- Import query-param helpers with `import { buildParamsConfig } from '@/utils/apiParams'` in domain API modules that accept filters.
- Response and standardized error payloads are converted to camelCase by the API client's response interceptor before callers read them.
- Form uploads should use the API client's FormData methods so payload keys and browser-managed multipart headers are not rewritten like JSON bodies.
- CSRF, credentials, timeout, base URL, and response interception belong inside the canonical API client instead of being configured in route code.
- Group API methods by domain and use consistent names such as `list`, `create`, `detail`, `update`, and `delete`.
- Specialized verbs such as `duplicate` are acceptable when they clearly describe a non-CRUD action.
- Type all responses and payloads.
- Use RESTful URL structures with IDs in the path and nested paths for related resources.
- Use `FormData` for uploads only when needed.
- Customize headers for uploads only when the request truly requires it.
- Use the shared query-param helper when one exists and let the API client handle casing conversion.
- Define domain API modules as top-level `const` blocks and export them through one unified API object.
- Order method parameters from most important to least important.
- Do not set Axios defaults in `main.ts`, stores, or route views; keep transport configuration inside the canonical client.

### API Error Handling

- Use the shared error helpers for standardized DRF error responses instead of parsing Axios errors directly in views or stores.
- Use `extractFirstFieldErrors(...)` for form field error maps and `extractFieldErrors(...)` when multiple messages per field are needed.
- Use `getFirstApiErrorMessage(...)` for workflow-level fallback messages, `getFirstApiErrorCode(...)` for code-specific behavior, and `getApiErrorStatus(...)` for status-specific behavior.
- Use `parseApiError(...)` only inside shared helpers or specialized flows that truly need the full standardized error object.
- Field-error keys should be treated as camelCase on the frontend, even when the backend returned snake_case `attr` values.
- Keep fallback user-facing error messages in the view or store that owns the workflow, but keep response-shape parsing in the shared error helpers.

### Casing Helpers

- `camelToSnake(...)`, `snakeToCamel(...)`, and `snakeFieldAttrToCamel(...)` are API-boundary utilities, not component-level formatting helpers.
- Do not call casing helpers from components, route views, or stores unless you are maintaining the shared API client, query-param helper, or error helpers.
- If a feature needs manual casing conversion, first check whether the data should instead flow through `apiClient`, `buildParamsConfig(...)`, or the shared error helpers.

## Type Discipline

- Do not use `any` or `unknown` at API transport boundaries.
- If the backend shape is uncertain, define an interface with optional fields instead of using `any`.
- If a method declares `Promise<ThingInterface>` or `Promise<ThingResponseInterface>`, it must return the unwrapped payload instead of an `AxiosResponse` object.
- Do not mix unwrapped model returns and `AxiosResponse` returns across API modules.
- Separate form DTOs from persisted entity models.
- Do not use placeholder IDs like `0` or `-1` in form state just to satisfy entity interfaces.
- Prefer `[Thing]RequestInterface` for data sent to the backend.
- Prefer descriptive names for data returned by the backend: use `[Thing]Interface` for persisted resources, names such as `[Thing]AvailableOptionsInterface` for option bundles, and `[Action]ResponseInterface` for endpoint-specific responses that do not have a clearer domain noun.
- Treat returned-data interfaces as API output contracts. Include backend-owned fields such as `id`, timestamps, status, nested output objects, and read-only derived values when the API returns them.
- Treat request interfaces as create/update/action payload and form contracts. Include only fields the frontend can submit, and omit backend-owned fields such as `id`, `createdTs`, `updatedTs`, and read-only derived values.
- Existing `[Thing]InputInterface` files do not need churn-only renames, but prefer `[Thing]RequestInterface` when adding a new API request contract.
- Do not create a dedicated filter interface by default. Type simple query params inline at the API method boundary and pass them through `buildParamsConfig(...)`; extract a named request interface only when the query shape is reused or complex.
- Prefer Zod-inferred request types when a form validates the same shape it submits, and colocate `createDefault...Request()` with that schema.

## Models And Stores

### Models

- Organize models by domain under `src/types/<domain>/`.
- Keep related models together inside the same domain folder.
- Use explicit filenames such as `[Thing]Interface.ts`, `[Thing]RequestInterface.ts`, `[Thing]AvailableOptionsInterface.ts`, `[Action]ResponseInterface.ts`, and `[Thing]Enums.ts` when those shapes exist.
- Store-related view models should live in shared model files rather than being declared inside stores or views.
- Request files may colocate a Zod schema plus a `createDefault...()` helper when that keeps form state and validation close to the request contract.
- Keep request interfaces and returned-data interfaces in separate files when an endpoint or resource has both read and write contracts.
- Keep enum definitions with the returned resource interface when they describe persisted or backend-returned values, and import those enums into request interfaces when forms need to submit them.

### Stores

- Use Pinia intentionally: keep cross-route shell state in shared shell stores, and keep route or feature state in route-local stores.
- Put route-only state in the route folder when that state is not reused elsewhere.
- Keep shared shell-level stores under the shell/application folder instead of a top-level catch-all `src/stores/` directory.
- Do not name local store files `store.ts`; use a descriptive name such as `contactsStore.ts`, `organizationSettingsStore.ts`, or `workspaceDetailStore.ts`.
- Shared shell stores should bootstrap cross-route context once, then expose selected organization, current user, or similar shell-level state for route views to consume.
- Prefer a route-local feature store when three or more route-local components share the same record, loading state, filters, form DTO, or mutation workflow.
- Let route-local feature stores own business state, data fetching, mutations, shared form state, permission-derived actions, and derived domain state used across sibling components.
- Let route-local components under `src/views/<route>/components/` import their colocated feature store directly when that removes prop chains and keeps ownership obvious.
- Keep shared components under `src/components/` store-agnostic and prop-driven even when route-local components are store-aware.
- Avoid passing route-local records, IDs, loading flags, error strings, and mutation callbacks through multiple component layers when the same route-local store can be consumed directly.
- Prefer one focused feature store per route or domain workflow instead of one giant app store.
- Reload data through store actions instead of manually clearing state.
- Use stable, deterministic keys for UI rows and lookup maps.
- If uniqueness depends on multiple fields, use a composite key instead of a display name.
- Do not implement fallback matching based on non-unique attributes.
- Access store state, getters, and actions directly on the store object instead of destructuring them.
- Replace optimistic or streamed array items with new objects instead of mutating captured raw references.

## UI And Component Conventions

### Shared UI

- Reuse existing components, tokens, and layout patterns before creating new ones.
- Prefer PrimeVue for foundational controls and surfaces when it fits the need.
- Do not rebuild standard buttons, inputs, dialogs, menus, tables, or common feedback patterns from scratch unless the shared component layer is a poor fit.
- Keep shared wrappers app-owned even when the implementation is backed by PrimeVue.
- Keep shared components under `src/components/` free of route-specific business logic, route params, API calls, and domain-store imports.
- When a PrimeVue-backed wrapper and a plain HTML wrapper solve the same item problem, keep their app-facing props as similar as practical and let only the internals differ.
- Keep component filenames PascalCase and composables prefixed with `use`.
- Favor shared SCSS or utility classes instead of inline styles unless values are dynamic.
- Prefer Tailwind flex utilities for layout before reaching for grid.
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes directly in components for shell, layout, and surface styling.
- Keep raw CSS limited to base reset concerns unless utilities are not sufficient.
- Keep modal structure consistent with header, body, footer, and accessibility attributes such as `role="dialog"` and `aria-label`.
- Reuse confirm dialogs for destructive actions.
- Respect existing responsive breakpoints when building or reusing dialogs.
- Use shared loading UI before introducing new spinners or progress banners.
- Use shared loading, error, and other feedback components before inventing local alternatives.
- Use the repository's shared clipboard helper instead of direct `navigator.clipboard` calls when one exists.
- Prefer extracting sizable UI blocks into subcomponents so pages stay readable.
- When a route view or shell view starts mixing several distinct sections, split those sections into local subcomponents so the parent reads like a page outline.
- Prefer route-local subcomponents under `src/views/<route>/components/` for route-specific panels, summaries, drawers, and list sections before promoting them into shared `src/components/`.
- When one component contains both desktop and mobile versions of the same UI, prefer small focused subcomponents when that split makes the responsive behavior easier to scan.
- Prefer shared UI inputs and keep spacing consistent with existing utility classes.
- Prefer page-composition wrappers for repeated screen structure so route views can read as page outlines instead of piles of low-level surface markup.
- For repeated resource lists, prefer a shared table or list wrapper that owns headings, loading state, empty state, and pagination slots while feature components supply filters and row markup.
- Prefer shared PrimeVue-based wrappers for shell and navigation primitives such as menus, drawers, and surfaces instead of repeating custom sidebar markup.
- Keep PrimeVue dialog, tooltip, dropdown, and autocomplete usage aligned with established shared patterns instead of introducing one-off variants.
- Avoid ambiguous bulk-table interactions: use explicit selection scope, unique row keys, and pre-sorted data when default ordering depends on multiple fields.
- Do not ship dashboards or cards backed only by placeholder values.

### Styling And Visual Consistency

- Follow established form layout, validation messaging, and table column ordering conventions.
- Keep semantic colors scoped to success, warning, and error states.
- Avoid ad hoc hex colors for surfaces, borders, hover states, and selected states.
- Promote repeated UI into reusable shared components only when reuse is real; otherwise keep composition view-local.
- Keep radii restrained and consistent across shells, cards, and controls.
- Use the same radius family across the workspace by default unless a component has a clear reason to deviate.
- Avoid introducing new global styles when shared utility patterns already exist.
- Align error and retry UI with shared patterns: shared error messages, warn-toned retry buttons, and minimal centered loading states.
- Prefer small shared PrimeVue wrappers for repeated control styling.
- Add tests for complex components using the same local patterns, such as unit, shallow-mount, or snapshot tests, when those patterns already exist in the feature area.

### Casing Discipline

- Frontend code uses camelCase everywhere.
- Backend API responses stay snake_case and are converted by the API client.
- Frontend request bodies and query params should be authored in camelCase and converted only at the API boundary.
- Never pass snake_case keys from components or stores to the API client.
- Never manually convert casing in components.

## Component Paradigms

- Do not mix Options API and Composition API in the same component.
- New code should use `<script setup lang="ts">`.
- If a legacy file uses Options API, keep that file internally consistent unless you are doing a full migration.

## Forms And Error Handling

### Forms

- Keep isolated one-off form state straightforward inside the local view, component, or dialog.
- When multiple route-local sections or dialogs edit the same record or share the same validation and save workflow, move that form DTO, field errors, and save action into the route-local feature store.
- Centralize DRF standardized-error parsing in shared frontend error helpers.
- Delete stale shared validation abstractions when they are no longer used.
- Follow the established validation and dialog examples for dual client and server error handling.
- For multi-step flows, keep the parent responsible for the shared DTO and active step, and let each step component own its local validation and submit or advance logic.

### Cascading Selects

- Use `resetField('fieldName')` to clear dependent fields without marking them touched or dirty.
- Do not directly assign `null` when the form library provides a reset helper.

### Dialog Ownership

- For isolated create or edit flows, dialogs can own their API calls, error handling, and success toasts.
- When a dialog participates in a larger route workflow shared with sibling sections, prefer a route-local feature store for fetch, mutation, shared form state, and success handling, and let the dialog stay focused on UI state and field rendering.
- Emit only the smallest event surface needed. If the dialog and parent already share a route-local store, prefer `close` or `cancel` events over replaying domain data through emits.
- Keep the parent route view focused on page composition, route lifecycle wiring, and navigation rather than forwarding business callbacks through several local layers.
- For admin and settings pages, prefer creation flows in focused dialogs while the page keeps the list or detail context.
- Prefer shared PrimeVue input helpers over ad hoc implementations, and await shared clipboard helpers before showing success UI.

## View Patterns

- Keep derived collections such as filtered rows and grouped data in `computed` getters.
- Use `usePolling` for auto-refresh behavior instead of manual intervals or timeouts.
- Guard optional identifiers before using them and return early when dependencies are missing.
- Use small helper functions for repeated lookups instead of inline template ternaries.
- Build view models with explicit loop-based transformers instead of long `map`/`filter`/`reduce` chains when clarity is better.
- Let route views compose shared `page/` wrappers, shared `ui/` controls, and route-local sections.
- Prefer one page-level shell store or parent view to own organization selection, bootstrap context, and shared loading/error state instead of re-fetching that context in each child page.
- For simple pages, route views can still own their fetch helpers and local computed data directly.
- For larger route folders, prefer a route-local feature store to own orchestration, data loading, mutation actions, stale-request guards, and shared workflow state, while the route view stays focused on page composition and route lifecycle wiring.
- Let route-local components consume the route-local feature store directly when doing so removes prop drilling and keeps the component API smaller.
- Keep data-fetch helpers focused on a single resource.
- Call data-fetch helpers sequentially when later requests depend on earlier metadata.
- Guard against stale async responses overwriting newer state when organization or route selection changes during a request.
- Follow the established polling and route-query examples for component polling, task polling, and URL-driven view state instead of ad hoc timers or path/query mixes.
- Fetch backend-provided defaults from the API instead of hardcoding the same values again in the client.

## Legacy Anti-Patterns And Tolerance

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid

- Do not perform heavy lookups, formatting, or ternaries inline in templates.
- Do not scatter ad hoc boolean flags across templates when they can be derived from a single source of truth.
- Do not use `.value` on nested refs or nested computeds in templates when a top-level computed would preserve clearer reactivity.
- Do not keep route-local business workflows split across a prop-heavy parent, several thin child wrappers, and multiple duplicated dialog submit handlers when one route-local feature store would make ownership clearer.

### Legacy Tolerance

- If the repository has a legacy frontend, keep the local file internally consistent while you work there instead of partially mixing old and new patterns.
- Do not reintroduce legacy frontend patterns into modern feature areas.
- For the application's modern frontend migration, treat `src/views/` as the target structure and avoid creating new route surfaces under `src/features/`.
- For the application's structure cleanup, avoid recreating top-level `src/stores/` or `src/services/` folders for modern code.

## Frontend Code Reference Workflow

- Identify an existing route or view folder similar to the one you are building.
- Inspect its route view, local subcomponents, local store usage, and API usage.
- List reusable pieces before coding.
- Reuse those pieces first, then add new code only when necessary.
- When reorganizing route code, prefer moving it into `src/views/` rather than creating or extending a parallel feature-root folder.
- When adding shared shell-level state, prefer `src/views/application/` before introducing a new global store directory.
- When adding transport helpers, prefer `src/utils/api.ts` and nearby utilities before introducing a new services root.
- Run the linter and formatter so the new code matches project style.

## Consistency Checklist

### Vue

- Component names and file casing are correct.
- Existing UI primitives are reused before new ones are created.
- Spacing and styling align with comparable features.
- API calls flow through the single canonical client.
- API boundary types avoid `any` and `unknown`.
- Components do not mix Options API and Composition API.
- Form state uses dedicated input types instead of entity models with placeholder IDs.
- Vue-specific examples live in the Vue `examples/` folder instead of inline guidance blocks.
- Session-backed auth uses the shared API client, shared shell store, route metadata, and one global router guard instead of route-local bootstrap or redirect logic.

## Project

# Brian Website Project Guidance

## Purpose

- Maintain a professional actor résumé / portfolio site for Brian: a place to showcase demo reels,
  headshots and gallery images, biography, résumé, and contact information.
- The site is currently a hand-authored **static site** (semantic HTML, modern CSS, a little
  vanilla JS) with **no build step**, so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages immediately.
- The site is intended to grow into a reactive static site (see "Future Direction"). Keep the
  current structure clean and framework-agnostic so that migration stays cheap.

## Source Of Truth

- Author project-specific guidance in this file. Do not edit generated files under `.claude/`,
  `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- `agents/` contains shared authored source installed from `GriffinBoris/Agents`. The `task
  agents:*` workflow preserves this project guidance while refreshing upstream-owned source.
- After changing authored guidance, run `task agents:generate:claude` (or `task agents:generate`
  for every harness) to rebuild integrations.
- The committed `.claude/` guidance is a generated build output kept in Git so the guidance is
  present on a fresh clone and in Claude Code web sessions. Other harness outputs
  (`.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, root `AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md`/`opencode.json`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are ignored by Git; regenerate them on demand.

## Repository Layout

- `index.html` — the single-page site entrypoint, served at the site root by GitHub Pages.
- `assets/css/` — stylesheets, split by concern:
  - `tokens.css` — design tokens (color, type scale, spacing) with light/dark `data-theme`
    variants. This is the single source of truth for the visual system; adapted from the
    `GriffinBoris/WebTemplate` frontend theme.
  - `base.css` — element resets and base typography.
  - `layout.css` — page shell, sections, containers, responsive rules.
  - `components.css` — buttons, cards, nav, gallery, and other reusable pieces.
- `assets/js/` — small, dependency-free scripts. `theme.js` owns the light/dark toggle
  (localStorage + `prefers-color-scheme`); `main.js` owns nav and progressive enhancement.
- `assets/img/` — headshots, gallery images, and Open Graph art. Uploaded later by the owner.
- `assets/media/` — demo reels / video (or links to external hosting for large files).
- `assets/resume/` — the downloadable résumé PDF. Uploaded later by the owner.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — builds and deploys the static site to GitHub Pages.

## Conventions

- **Static, no build.** Do not introduce a bundler, package manager, or Node dependency unless
  the migration to a reactive stack is explicitly requested. Keep everything servable as plain
  files so `git push` is the only deploy step.
- **Design tokens first.** Never hard-code a raw color or font size in a component. Reference the
  CSS custom properties in `tokens.css`. Add a token before adding a one-off value.
- **Theming.** Support light and dark via `html[data-theme="…"]`. Every color must resolve from a
  token so both themes stay correct. The toggle must degrade gracefully with JS disabled.
- **Accessibility & semantics.** Use landmark elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`,
  `footer`), meaningful `alt` text, visible focus states, and sufficient contrast in both themes.
- **Performance.** Prefer optimized/responsive images, lazy-load below-the-fold media, and avoid
  blocking scripts. This is a portfolio; first impression and load speed matter.
- **Prose & tone.** Copy should read as a professional, confident actor's site — warm, concise,
  free of filler. Placeholder copy is clearly marked so the owner can replace it.
- **Content the owner supplies later** (résumé, headshots, reel) lives under `assets/` in the
  folders above. Wire the markup to those paths now; use lightweight placeholders until real
  assets land.

## Future Direction

- The site is expected to become a **reactive static site**. When that migration is requested,
  Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind is the house stack (see `GriffinBoris/WebTemplate`), and the framework
  and Vue guidance packages in `agents/guidance/` apply. Until then, treat the Python, Django,
  and Vue guidance as reference for the eventual stack, not as active constraints on the current
  hand-authored HTML/CSS.

## Verification

- There is no test suite yet. Before committing, sanity-check the site by opening `index.html`
  in a browser (or `python3 -m http.server`) and confirm: both themes render correctly, the nav
  works, layout is responsive, and no console errors appear.
- Validate that all asset paths referenced in the markup exist (or are intentional placeholders).
